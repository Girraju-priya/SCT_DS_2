### Internship Task 02 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset using Power BI

💼 SkillCraft Technology | 📅 July 2025

### 📌 Overview

This task focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle using Power BI. The objective is to derive insights into survival patterns based on **passenger class, gender, age, fare, and embarkation port**, presented through interactive visuals and dynamic dashboards.

---

### 📁 Dataset Details

* **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
* **Key Columns Used**:

  * `Survived`: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
  * `Pclass`: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
  * `Sex`: Gender of the passenger
  * `Age`: Age in years
  * `Fare`: Ticket fare
  * `Embarked`: Port of Embarkation
  * `Cabin`: Cabin number

#### ✅ Dashboard Features:

* 📌 **Filters for Class & Embarkation Port** – dynamic filtering for focused analysis
* 📈 **Histogram of Age Distribution** – reveals passenger age patterns (mean: \~35.67)
* 🟧 **Bar Chart: Survived by Class** – shows most survivors from 1st class (115)
* 🟨 **Bar Chart: Survived by Sex** – female survival rate visibly higher (89 vs 45)
* 🍩 **Donut Chart: Cabin Count by Sex** – gender-based cabin distribution
* 💸 **Fare Distribution Area Chart** – identifies outliers and general fare trends
* 📊 **KPI Cards** – highlight total survivors and fare metrics

---

### ✅ Summary of Insights

* 👩‍🦰 **Females had significantly higher survival rates** compared to males
* 🏆 **1st class passengers** had the highest survival count
* 👶 Majority of passengers were aged between **20–40 years**
* 🌍 Embarkation filters allow regional survival pattern analysis
* 🛠 Dashboard is designed for **interactive EDA and insight discovery**

---

### 🧠 Learnings

* 🧩 Creating an EDA dashboard from raw datasets
* 📊 Using **Power BI charts, filters, and KPIs** to derive real-time insights
* 🎯 Importance of visual storytelling in understanding survival patterns
* ✨ Hands-on experience in **data cleaning, modeling, and dashboard design**
